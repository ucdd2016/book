## Objectives

* Team: Propose a _together_ app
* Individual: Revise your personal book

## Due

* Team: Friday @ 11:59pm, 2/26/2016
* Individual: Monday @ 3pm, 2/29/2016

## Hints

* While the team homework deadline is the same as usual, it's _highly recommended_
that you form your team early so that you have plenty of time to propose.
* The individual homework's intent is give you an opportunity to review and
really understand your own teams' apps made so far. If you already have a pretty good grasp
of your teams' works along the way, this part should take less time. If you feel you are
behind a bit, please start early. Don't wait until the weekend.
