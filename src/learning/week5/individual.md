# Individual Learning

## Objective

Come up with an idea for a novel real-time collaborative app for
 _doing something together_,
assuming about 10 to 40 people can participate at the same time.

One classic example is Google Doc for collaborative text editing. But
text editing is so boring. Can you think of something novel, creative, and fun?
Here some possible verbs to get your creative mind start spinning:
create, play, build, fix, help, control ... etc

## Ideation

* What is the name of your app?
* What collaborative activity can people do together using your app?
* What is the ideal number of concurrent users (must be at least 10 but no more than 40)?
* What skills do people need in order to do this activity?
* Is this activity for fun or for something practical?
* How can a person see what everyone else is doing?
* How can a person see the most recent result of everyone's collaborative effort?
* What can an admin see (i.e., God's mode)?

## Mockup

Create a high-fidelity mockup of your app. The mockup should contain any
number of pages you think is necessary to illustrate your idea.

## Submission

* Deploy to Firebase. Your mockups should be publicly visible via `<Your Firbase>`[/apps/together/mockup/](/apps/together/mockup/index.html)
* The answers to your ideation questions must be included in the mockup's
index page.
* Use [http://recordit.co/](http://recordit.co/) to create a demo as an animated
gif. Post it to [#demo](https://ucdd2016.slack.com/messages/demo/).

## What's Next?

After the Uber app, we will be building this _together_ app, so we are just preparing
for that now. The ultimate goal is that in four weeks when this together app is
functional, we will do live-demos in class. All of us will sign into the app
at the same time to _do something together_ in real-time.

Next week, we will collect ideas from all students and put similar ideas together.
People with similar ideas will be grouped together to further refine the their
ideas into a single idea, which will become a proposal for the next app.
