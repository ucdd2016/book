# Intro

Welcome to the 2016 edition of UCDD II!

Today is introduction. We will go through the three major learning components
of this class:

1. Team Learning (Due: every Friday @ 11:59pm)
2. Individual Learning (Due: every Sunday @ 11:59pm)
3. Hackathon (starts the following Monday @ 4pm)

## Team Learning

### Objective

Develop a TODO list app.

### Teaming

* Four people per team.
* No more than 2 graduate students on each team.
* Teams will change every three or four weeks.

### Milestones

* [x] _EVERYONE_ should fork the Git repository of this book.
* [x] Get the template code in [apps/todos/index.html](/apps/todos) to run
* [x] Modify the code to show your team's name
* [x] Use your team's own Firebase to serve the task data

### Submission

* The deadline is always Friday @ 11:59pm.
* Source code is pushed to Github.
* App is deployed at Firebase.
* Only one person needs to be responsible for submitting by the deadline.

## Individual Learning

### Objective

* Display each task as a Card using the appropriate
[materializecss class labels](http://materializecss.com/cards.html).

### Submission

* The deadline is always Sunday @ 11:59pm.
* Source code is pushed to Github.
* App is deployed at Firebase.
* Each person is responsible for submitting his or her own work by the deadline.

## Hackathon

At the beginning of each hackathon, a list of new (secret) feature requirements will
be released. Your team will be given some amount of time to add these requirements
to your app.

### Feature Requirements
* Use an object to represent each task (rather than using a string) so that
each task can have multiple fields.
* Each task object should have two fields: _title_, and _priority_. Priority can be
_high_, _medium_, _low_.

### Submission

* The deadline is sometime during the class, depending on the hackathon's level
of difficulty.
* Your team's updated app (with the new requirements implemented) should be deployed
at Firebase.

### Presentation

After the time is up, we will have presentations from teams. Sometimes we
have time for every team to present. Sometimes we will select only a few teams.
