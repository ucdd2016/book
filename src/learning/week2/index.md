# Week 2

## Team Learning

### Objective

ToDos App v.3

Your clients came back with even more requirements. They want to be able
to edit the tasks directly through the app (not through the Firebase dashboard).

### Due

Friday @ 11:59pm, 1/22/2016

### Requirements

* [ ] There should be an inbox page ([inbox.html](/apps/todos/inbox.html)) for adding a
new task.
* [ ] Each new task should _at least_ have the following fields:
  - title
  - priority
  - assigned (someone's Github id)
  - due (a date)
  - completed (always set to false when it's created)
* [ ] In the main page ([index.html](/apps.todos/index.html)), each task should have a complete button. When clicked,
the task is marked as complete, and the visual representation of this task should be updated
accordingly.

## Individual Learning

### Due

Sunday @ 11:59pm, 1/24/2016

### Requirements

* [ ] Add a __Tasks__ section the main page of your resume app ([index.html](/apps/resume/index.html)).
This section should displays a list of tasks assigned to you. These tasks are pulled from your team's Firebase.
* [ ] Create a __Subscribe__ page ([subscribe.html](/apps/resume/subscribe.html)).
This page should have a simple text box for a visitor (e.g., prospective employer)
to enter an email  address to subscribe to a mailing list. Each email address should
be stored to the Firebase. Also, the page should display all the subscribers' emails.

### Submission

* __Commit/Push__ your source code to Github.
* __Deploy__ your resume app to Firebase
