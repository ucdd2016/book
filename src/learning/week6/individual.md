# Individual Learning

## Objectives

* Revise the design of your _together_ app.
* Create an initial sketch of the required data model.

## Revise

Revise your design to meet the two requirements below:

* The client screen should fit in an iPad screen (768 x 1024). A user should not need to scroll.
* The client should be able to have _awareness_ of what every other user is
doing concurrently. For instance, in Google Doc, you can see which sentence
or word another user is currently editing. In Slack, you can see whether
each person is currently typing. What would be your app's _awareness_ feature?

## Data Models

Write a sketch of the data models you will need in the real-time database (Firebase)
in order to support your app.

## Submission
* __Revision__. 
* __Data Model__. Put your writeup in `/apps/together/mockup/data.md` which will generate [`/apps/together/data.html`](/apps/together/mockup/data.html)
