# Execution

For our site, there are two pages. One page is the admin page, and one is the client page. 
The client page is for chip's fans to be able to see where chip is. The fans only see the active chip location(s) and they can see other chip fans and their locations. When they login with GitHub and press their location on the map, their location data is updated in firebase and their location is displayed on the map.
The admin page has a button titled "send out my location". Chip can submit where he is located for chip fans to see by activating the location where Chip is.
