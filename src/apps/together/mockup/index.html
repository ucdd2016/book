            <h1>Mockup</h1>
            <h3><a href="/apps/together/mockup/code/index.html">Code Together</a></h3>
            <h1>Writeup</h1>
            <h6>What is the name of your app?</h6>
            Code Together
            <h6>What collaborative activity can people do together using your app?</h6>
            Users can create apps and code with the help of their friends and teammates.
            <h6>What is the ideal number of concurrent users (must be at least 10 but no more than 40)?</h6>
            An ideal number of concurrent users would be around 15. More than
            this will cause unavoidable conflicts, unless the code base is huge.
            However, it is enough users that the full pain of typical team
            coding tools like code reviews and git start to show their
            weakenesses.
            <h6>What skills do people need in order to do this activity?</h6>
            Users must be able to user a web browser and keyboard. Hopefully,
            they will also have a microphone or webcam. This will let them code
            much more easily than current tools, with a mentor. Unlike
            conventional tools, like Unix and Vim, this will be very easy to
            learn, and social. Hopefully this will encourage more beginners,
            especially people who would otherwise not be interested in computer
            science.
            <h6>Is this activity for fun or for something practical?</h6>
            This is going to be a practical tool at first, and targetted at
            users who have experienced the pain of coding with a group, using
            tools like Vim and Git. However, hopefully the tool will be so easy
            to use that beginners will start using it.
            <h6>How can a person see what everyone else is doing?</h6>
            Users can see what others are doing by viewing their cursor,
            automatic running of tests to detect conflicting changes, and video
            communication. Users will be able to see when changes they make
            affect another user because we will run unit tests automatically,
            and show the results in the IDE.
            <h6>How can a person see the most recent result of everyone’s collaborative effort?</h6>
            Users can see other's activity in the cursor position log, and also
            can see all open chat rooms. Viewing the open chat rooms will let
            users get expert help when they need it.
            <h6>What can an admin see (i.e., God’s mode)?</h6>
            We will have a page that will list all user's cursor positions. This
            will let us anticipate conflicting changes, and avoid effort
            duplication.
