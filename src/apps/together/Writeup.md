# Project Write Up

## Music_Together!

* Music_Together allows people to easily collaborate and make music together! Finally, users can now use the power of numbers to write scores never imagined! The ideal number of users would be 10, but there is no limit to how many people can work together to be in such a creative process! The only skills anyone needs to start out with is the enjoyment of creating something new, and well reading music. You do not have to be a music major, but a background in reading notes will be helpful, but that is not the end all. You can listen and use your ears to place the notes as well. The activity will allow people to work together to create new music which will be fun but could also make a few bucks if it is good enough. A person will be able to see the activity of the other users and see past activity as well. Each user will be denoted by a cursor bar (much like Google Docs). The most recent results will automatically be pushed to each page. The Admin will be able to approve changes to a score before they become final.  

## How we are going to do it

* We are going to use techniques from class and use realtime updating. We will use Firebase to keep track of the active users. The music notes will be stored in Firebase as well, and when they are edited they will be updated realtime to every user's screen. We will also keep track of active users.
