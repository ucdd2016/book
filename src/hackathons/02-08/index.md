# Hackathon: Uber for ????

## Objective

Come up with a new startup idea for providing real-time, location-based matching
between customers and service providers, much like Uber matching riders
(customers) to drivers (service providers).

## Team

We will make new teaming arrangements this week. Thank your current teammates
for their contributions during the past two weeks.  Say hello to your new teammates.

## Ideation

Time: 30 minutes

* What is the name of your startup?
* What services does your startup provide?
* Who can use the services?
* Who can join as the service providers?
* What are the main data attributes of a service provider (e.g., name, stars, location)?
* Which city will your startup initially launch?
* What is the price for a customer to pay for a service? What are the factors determining the price?
* How much can a service provider earn?

## Mockup

Time: 1 hour

Create a high-fidelity mockup of your app. Your app should have three components:

### Index

[/apps/uber/mockup/](/apps/uber/mockup/index.html)

* [ ] Contains your team's answers to the questions under Ideation.
* [ ] Contains links to the client page and the admin page.

### Client

[/apps/uber/mockup/client.html](/apps/uber/mockup/client.html)

* [ ] A client can see where service providers are on a map
* [ ] A client can see where he/she is on a map
* [ ] A client can see details about a provider
* [ ] A client can login and logout

### Admin

[/apps/uber/mockup/admin.html](/apps/uber/mockup/admin.html)

* [ ] An admin can see all the service providers
* [ ] An admin can see all the clients

## Tools
* For non-map components, use [materializecss](http://materializecss.com/).
* For map components, take a screenshot of Google Map and use any drawing
software to add markups to the screenshot. Simply include the screenshot in your mockup.

## Submission

* Deploy to Firebase. Your mockups should be publicly visible via the following
links
  * `<Your Firbase>`[/apps/uber/mockup/](/apps/uber/mockup/index.html)
  * `<Your Firbase>`[/apps/uber/mockup/client.html](/apps/uber/mockup/client.html)
  * `<Your Firbase>`[/apps/uber/mockup/admin.html](/apps/uber/mockup/admin.html)
* Use [http://recordit.co/](http://recordit.co/) to create a demo as an animated
gif. Post it to [#demo](https://ucdd2016.slack.com/messages/demo/) and together
with your team members' names.

## Next

In this week's learning homework, you will take the first step to develop
a functional prototype of the app you are designing.
