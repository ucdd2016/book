# Hackathon: Uber for ??? (II)

Date: 02-15-2016

## Objectives

* Do two rounds of mini-demos to a small subset of the class
* Make a plan to prepare for a live-demo to the entire class and guest judges in one-week time

## Demo

Total time: 20 minutes (10 minutes per round x 2)

We will do two rounds of mini demos. Split your team into halves. During each round,
one half (presenters) will stay and present a demo.  The other half
(audience) will go to other teams to listen to their demos. The roles will switch
between rounds.

As presenters, the goal of a mini demo is to practice talking about your app to
an audience. What you want to talk about is up to you.

As audience, try to evenly distribute across the presenting teams so each team
has 3 or 4 audience members.

## Plan

Total Time: 30 minutes

Discuss among the team to come up with a plan to further develop your app in order
to
  * Present a real live-demo (described in [What's Next](#what-s-next-))
  * Respond to feedback (not all, just the most important ones)

The format of the plan is up to you. Leverage the skills you've acquired from
previous CS classes (e.g., Tools and Methods).

## Submission

Write your plan in `/apps/uber/demo/plan.md` which will generate [`/apps/uber/demo/plan.html`](/apps/uber/demo/plan.html). Publish your plan by
deploying the update to the Firebase.

## What's Next?

Next Monday (2-22), we will organize a live-demo event. Each team will have a chance to present this prototype to the whole class and to a panel of judges.

The flow of the demo is described below:

* Each member should take on one (or two if the team size is small)
of the following roles:
  * One person will deliver an elevator pitch
  * One person will demo the _client_ screen
  * One person will demo the _admin_ screen
  * One person will demo the Firebase data models
  * One person will discuss what feedback has been incorporated
* Meanwhile, everyone in the audience will visit the app and try to
  * login
  * change locations

Just like a typical hackathon, we will select people's and judges' award winners.
