# Hackathon: ToDos v2

Date: 01-18-2016

## Objective

Your clients liked the initial version of the ToDos app you built. They came
back with a list of new requirements. Build them!

## Due

Tuesday @ 11:59pm, 1/19/2016

## Requirements
* [x] There should be three separate pages showing tasks with different priority values. We did this dynamically
* [x] The landing page of the app ([index.html](/apps/todos/index.html)) should contain
a navigation bar with links to these three pages.
* [x] When a task's priority value is modified (e.g., medium --> high), all four pages
 (index, low, medium, high) are automatically refreshed.
